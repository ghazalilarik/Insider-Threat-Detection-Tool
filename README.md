### Insider Threat Detection Tool

#### Introduction
This tool leverages machine learning to detect insider threats based on employee activity data. It uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify anomalous patterns in behavior, such as unusual access times or unauthorized file access. The system is designed to provide organizations with an early warning mechanism for potential insider threats.

#### Features
- **Behavior Analysis**: Analyzes employee behavior data, such as login times and file access patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies that indicate insider threats.
- **Customizable**: Supports training with historical data and real-time detection with new data.

#### Usage Instructions
1. **Setup Dependencies**: Install necessary packages using `pip`.
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
    ```
2. **Prepare Data**: Ensure the data is available in CSV format with the following columns:
   - `employee_id`: Unique ID of each employee.
   - `login_time`: Login timestamp in the format `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`.
   - `access_time`: Access timestamp in the format `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`.
   - `access_level`: Level of access (e.g., confidential, restricted).
   - `files_accessed`: Number of files accessed during the session.

3. **Run the Tool**: Use the command below to train the model and make predictions based on new data.
    ```sh
    python insider_threat_detection.py
    ```

#### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6 or above**: Ensure you have Python installed in your system.
- **Historical Activity Data**: Training requires past employee activity data (`employee_activity_log.csv`).
- **Scikit-learn**: The tool uses scikit-learn for machine learning.

#### How It Works
1. **Load Data**: The tool loads historical data to train the Isolation Forest model.
2. **Preprocess Data**: The data is preprocessed, including timestamp conversions and feature encoding.
3. **Train Model**: An Isolation Forest model is trained on the normalized historical data.
4. **Predict Threats**: The model is used to analyze new employee activity, detecting potential insider threats.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository from GitHub.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
3. **Configure Training Data**: Provide a CSV file with historical employee activity for model training.
4. **Run the Tool**: Run the script to detect insider threats using `python insider_threat_detection.py`.
